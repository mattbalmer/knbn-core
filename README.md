# knbn-core

Core logic and types for `knbn`.

## Workflow

The types and logic of this package are meant to be as open-ended as possible - but keep in mind that the designs flowed from my own personal workflow requirements.

I hope the tool can be used in different workflows for different people or groups - please feel free to make suggestions or open PRs.

### Sprints

"Sprints" in KnBn are a loose term. They could just as easily be called "milestones" or "initiatives" or even "epics". They are simply a way to group tasks together for a specific time period or goal.

The start and end dates for sprints are optional, so feel free to ignore them if your workflow doesn't require sequential sprints.

### Columns vs Backlog

Columns are intended for active tasks, and any task without a column is considered part of the backlog.

This allows a clear distinction between tasks that are currently being worked on and those that are waiting to be picked up.

### Priority

Priority is an optional number, with lower numbers indicating higher priority. Tasks without a priority are always displayed below those with any priority.
